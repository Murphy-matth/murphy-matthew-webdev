#### About me
I am an undergraduate student in my 4th year at Northeastern University studying 
Computer Engineering and Computer Science. 
I have experience with C++ and Java doing development in Android, IOS, and Embedded Systems. 
I have done two co-ops, my first at Manulife/John Hancock and my second at a startup called Xperiel located in 
Sunnyvale, CA. I am returning to Xperiel for my third co-op.
